Excel file creation with specified content and formatting is not directly executable as text. However, I will outline the structured content that should be included in the file. The detailed Excel setup should follow these guidelines:

### Sheet: Calculation

#### Parameters Table:
| Parameter | Value | Unit |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Hf        |       |      |
| ψ         |       |      |
| v         |       |      |
| η         |       |      |
| t         |       |      |
| Δt        |       |      |
| t_max     |       |      |

#### Calculation of Q(t):
- Q(t) = [Insert formula based on parameters]

#### Time Table:
| Time (s) | Q(t) (unit) |
|----------|-------------|
| 0        |             |
| Δt       |             |
| 2Δt      |             |
| ...      |             |
| t_max    |             |

#### Chart:
- Embedded chart showing Q(t) vs Time

### Formatting:
- Highlight input cells for parameters.
- Headers should include units for clarity.
- Formulas must be included for automatic calculations.
- The time series generation should be automatic based on the parameters.
- The chart should be styled for better visualization.
